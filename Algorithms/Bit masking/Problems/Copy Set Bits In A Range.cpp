/* Problem:
You are given two numbers A and B. You are given two more numbers left and right, representing a range [left,right].
You have to set bits in B which are set in A lying in the above mentioned range and leave the remaining as it is.  Print the updated number B.
ex: A= 10 -> 10101010101  [3,7] range
                 ^   ^
    B= 13 -> 10010011001

        ans: 10011011101 -> 15
