DP on grids/2D matrix
    -> Count Paths
    -> Count paths with obstacles
    -> Min. Path sum
    -> Max Path sum
    -> Triangle problem
    -> 2 start points

Do all possible ways -> Recurssion -> recurrence
    1) Express all terms in terms of index (i,j) i-->row  j-->col, Base case
    2) Explore/Do all stuffs 
    3) Sum all choices -> for counting no. of ways
       find max/min of all choices -> find min max accordingly
