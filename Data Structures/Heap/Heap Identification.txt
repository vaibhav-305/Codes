Heap is used when in question there is:
    1) someting related to k (k is a number)
    2) smallest or largest
-> Basically those question where sorting is direct solution, heap can be applied there
-> Heap can bring time complexity from n*log(n) --> n*log(k)
-> For kth smallest --> max heap , we'll push if the element is less than top() and then pop one out after it,
   For kth largest --> min heap , we'll push if the element is greater than top() and then pop one out after it,
   After travering the input, the top() will be the answer.
